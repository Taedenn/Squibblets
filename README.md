# Squibblets
Squibblets is a 2nd Grade-level math game meant to encourage addition and subtraction skills. It was primarily created in Unity and distributed through itch.io. We practiced AGILE-based development in a team of 4 developers, where I mostly focused on visual design, player movement, collision, animations, and level design. The major take-away from this project was learning how to collaborate and coordinate our code through github with merges and resolving file conflicts. I also really enjoyed setting goals for our project and working through various issues and tackling new concepts in order to meet them in time for each release.
